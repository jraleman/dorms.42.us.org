## Project Structure

The idea of having a good project structure is to have a cross platform
project, to maximize code reuse, keep the configurations out of the code,
and minimize the component state.

This is the main idea for the source code:

```
dorms.42.us.org/
├── css/
│   ├── animate.css
|  ...
│   └── style.css
├── images/
    ├── favicon.css
│   └── ...
├── fonts/
│   ├── fontawesome-webfont3e6e.eot
|  ...
│   └── poppins-regular-webfont.woff2
├── js/
│   ├── bootstrap.min.js
|  ...
│   └── wow.min.js
└── index.html

```
